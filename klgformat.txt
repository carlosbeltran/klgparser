The structure of the klg file like following:

<number of frames encoded as 32 bit int>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<timestamp encoded as 64 bit int>
<depthsize encoded as 32 bit int>
<imagesize (rgb) encoded as 32 bit int>
<depth buffer zlib compressed in the following depthsize number of bytes>
<rgb buffer jpeg compressed in the following imagesize number of bytes>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The parts between dashes repeated number of frame times. opencv library with
python is easy choice uncompressing images. Be careful about little little
endian and big endians. I installed (to Omron pc ) and used bless (there are
some other softwares too) for reading binary klg file to understand if the
numbers are encoded as little or big endians. As far as i remember for example
number of frames was encoded as little endians . So when you are reading data
from binary file if the numbers does not make sense at first glance it is
because of this. Depth images  zlib compressed unsigned 16 bit images. The
color images are jpeg compressed uint8 bits typical rgb images.  While
uncompressing images the  color image (most probably will be) can be in BGR
form so it can be transformed easily to RGB using opencv library.
